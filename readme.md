# React register form with ARIA👨‍🦯

* This is a react-vite made registration form that takes into account Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) for visually imparied or challenged users. It allows for screen readers to tell the user what information is pertinent at each moment, whether it is the current highlighted input or any instructions to be followed, as well as any error.

* It uses plain state variables for validation. No formik, yup, zod whatsoever. Input rules are stipulated in REGEX variables.

Have a nice day🌥
